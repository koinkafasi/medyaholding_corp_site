# Carousel Component

The **Carousel** component displays a scrollable list of members, using GSAP for smooth animations and responsive behavior.  
It supports light/dark themes and dynamically adjusts how many cards are visible based on the screen width.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**  
  Adjusts the number of visible items based on screen width:  
  - `< 640px` → 1 item visible  
  - `< 1024px` → 3 items visible  
  - `≥ 1024px` → 4 items visible

- **Smooth GSAP Animation**  
  Uses `gsap.to()` for elegant sliding transitions.

- **Interactive Controls**  
  Includes **Previous** and **Next** buttons with disabled states at the edges.

- **Dark Mode Support**  
  Compatible with Tailwind’s `dark:` classes for theme switching.

- **Reusable Structure**  
  Simple prop-based design for easy integration into any section.
